# **Blazing Star - Replace Bonus Sound**

This patch changes the voice that says "bonus", whenever you pick up a bonus item (or excess power items at full power). It has no other effect. The sound effect that replaces the voice, is the lucky panel item pickup sound.


## Patching Instructions:

1 - Extract your MAME Blazing Star rom archive (blazstar.zip).

2 - Using your xdelta patcher of choice, apply the bstar-rbs.xdelta patch to the file named "239-p1.p1". Make sure that your patched file has the same filename as the original.

3 - Rezip the Blazing Star rom archive.
  
  
##### NOTE: When you start up the patched rom, MAME will complain about wrong checksum. This is expected, and can be safely ignored. If necessary, the patching process can be verified using the hashes below:
